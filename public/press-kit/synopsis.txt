AI-BORN: THE MACHINE CORE, THE HUMAN CORTEX, AND THE NEXT ECONOMY OF BEING

ONE-PAGE SYNOPSIS

When three people can orchestrate what once required 30,000, the enterprise—and human purpose—must be redesigned from first principles. AI-Born is the blueprint for that transformation.

THE PREMISE

This is not another book about AI tools. AI-Born is a field manual for designing institutions where autonomous agents execute, learn, and adapt—and where humans provide intent, judgement, and taste. Blending systems architecture with moral philosophy, it shows how to rebuild the enterprise for an age when three people can orchestrate what once took thirty thousand.
