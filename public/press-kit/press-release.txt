FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

AI-BORN: NEW BOOK OFFERS BLUEPRINT FOR AI-NATIVE ORGANISATIONS

Mehran Granfar's Definitive Field Manual Shows How to Rebuild Enterprise
for an Age When Three People Can Orchestrate What Once Took Thirty Thousand

[CITY, DATE] — In an era where autonomous intelligence is rapidly transforming how organisations operate, a new book offers a comprehensive blueprint for designing institutions that are AI-native from the ground up. AI-Born: The Machine Core, the Human Cortex, and the Next Economy of Being by Mehran Granfar presents a systematic framework for enterprise transformation that goes far beyond simply adding AI tools to existing processes.

"This is not another book about AI tools," says Granfar, Founder & CEO of Adaptic.ai. "AI-Born is a field manual for designing institutions where autonomous agents execute, learn, and adapt—and where humans provide intent, judgement, and taste."

THE AI-NATIVE IMPERATIVE

Traditional organisations are built around human labour as the primary execution layer. But as autonomous agents become capable of handling increasingly complex tasks, the fundamental architecture of the enterprise must change. AI-Born provides the roadmap for this transformation, offering frameworks that span technical architecture, governance design, and human purpose.

CORE FRAMEWORKS

The book introduces several groundbreaking concepts:

• The Five Planes: A complete architecture stack for AI-born organisations, from data foundations to governance protocols

• The Defensibility Stack: Where competitive moats live in the AI-native era—Architecture, Governance, Evolution speed, Trust, and Distribution

• The New Triumvirate: Redefining human roles as Architect (system design), Intent-Setter (strategic direction), and Guardian (ethical oversight)

• Iteration Half-Life: How to compress decision cycles as a competitive advantage

• Cognitive Overhead Index: A diagnostic tool for measuring institutional drag

PRAGMATIC AND HOPEFUL

Unlike dystopian narratives about AI replacing humans, AI-Born presents a pragmatic and ultimately hopeful vision. The book argues that as machines scale the "how," humans must choose a "why" worthy of the unprecedented power we now wield.

"The question isn't whether AI will transform organisations—it's whether we'll design that transformation with intention or allow it to happen by default," Granfar explains.
